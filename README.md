# Bubble Tea Time:  Back-End API

Note: The API and database for this project were originally hosted on Heroku's free tier which is sadly no longer available. Unfortunately, that means the Bubble Tea Time app is no longer fully functional.

[Bubble Tea Time](http://seatuna.github.io/bubble-tea-time/index.html)

[Bubble Tea Front-End](https://github.com/seatuna/bubble-tea-time) is the front-end for this web app.

This web app allows users to view drink menus from Boston-area bubble tea shops.
These items display information about the main ingredients of the drink,
toppings, and other information pertinent to the user’s bubble tea experience.
Most of the time, drink names at these bubble tea shops are not intuitive
(unless you can read Chinese).  For example, Kung Fu Tea has a drink called
“Red Wow Milk,” what is that!?  And a lot of people don’t realize that you don’t
have to get tapioca in your tea, there’s other stuff you can put in it (like
aloe, or coconut jelly)!  My app will help demystify the wonderful world of this
in-aptly named but much beloved Taiwanese beverage.
